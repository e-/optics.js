{"name":"Optics.js","tagline":"JavaScript implementation for OPTICS density-based clustering algorithm.","body":"# optics.js\r\n\r\noptics.js is an open source JavaScript library which implements OPTICS clustering algorithm for *browsers* and *node.js*. For more detailed information about OPTICS clustering algorithm , refer to the below paper.\r\n> Ankerst, Mihael, et al. \"OPTICS: ordering points to identify the clustering structure.\" ACM SIGMOD Record 28.2 (1999): 49-60.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n`optics(data, minPts, epsilon, getter, dist)` returns an array of class `Point`.\r\n  \r\n* `data`: An array of data to be clustered.\r\n* `minPts`: Defined in the forementioned paper.\r\n* `epsilon` Defined in the forementioned paper.\r\n* `getter`: *Optional.* If `data` contains other data structures (e.g. Object) rather than vectors (an array of numbers), you should specify how to get a vector from each element of `data`. The default value is an identity function (e.g. `function(d){return d;}`) which means each element of `data` is used as a vector.\r\n* `dist`: *Optional.* A distance function which computes the distance between two vectors. If not specified, the Euclidan distance function is used.\r\n\r\nClass `Point` contains the result of OPTICS clustering for one element of `data`\r\n\r\n* `point.datum` \r\n* `point.isProcessed` \r\n* `point.coreDistance` \r\n* `point.reachability` \r\n* `point.index` \r\n   \r\n## LICENSE\r\n&copy; 2014, Jaemin Jo.
